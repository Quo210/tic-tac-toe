Personal Notes:

One of the main objetives of this project is learning to use 'Modular' writing in JS. The features are:

- Modules are self contained - they have everything they need inside them.
- No global variables.
- Modules should manage only one thing. Otherwise it should be split up.
- Do not repeat yourself (DRY)
- No memory leaks
- Very few selections-selectors
- A function that lives inside an object is a *method*
